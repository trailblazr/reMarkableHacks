# reMarkableHacks
All kind of things to tweak your reMarkable Tablet.

## Custom status screens
Here you can get some custom status screens in **german** (ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª) language. The original screens are in **english** (ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸) only.

Put them in following directories:

* `/usr/share/remarkable`
* `/usr/share/remarkable-shutdown`
* `/var/lib/uboot/`

Have some fun!
